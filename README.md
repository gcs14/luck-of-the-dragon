Luck of the Dragon

This program is a text-based adventure game based on medieval folklore:

You are a courageous knight on a quest to save the lost princess of Ghadia from Hellfire Tower, 
home to the sinister dragon, Urtho. This dragon is immortal and can not be beaten my might alone.
He soon grows tired of your battle as he has won so many. You must find another way to best the 
dragon and save the princess.

Not all stories end happily ever after.
